## What You Need

Before we start, make sure you have these essentials:

- **Git Skills:** Master version control using [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your local machine.
- **Coding Setup:** Create your coding space with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Using Git

Here's a roadmap to guide you through setting up Git repositories, cloning, editing, and pushing your work:

```bash
# Begin your journey by cloning the repository onto your local environment.
git clone <Github URL>
# Edit your code within Visual Studio Code.
git add <file>
git add .
# Save your creative changes in the code history.
git commit -m "<message>"
git push origin <branch>
```
